# Scientific Hand Movement Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive system for analyzing hand movements from videos using MediaPipe. It's designed to extract detailed kinematic data and generate scientific insights, particularly for comparing subject groups (e.g., "SEE" vs. "BLIND").

## üöÄ Quick Start

The primary analysis script is `complete_comprehensive_analysis.py`. It orchestrates the entire analysis pipeline, from data extraction to generating final reports.

### How to Run the Main Analysis

To generate all primary results, including plots, statistical tables, and data files for Large Language Model (LLM) analysis, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python complete_comprehensive_analysis.py
```

This single command will:
1.  Read all individual `analysis_report.txt` files from the `analysis_results/ID*/` directories.
2.  Compute comprehensive statistics, comparing the "SEE" and "BLIND" groups.
3.  Generate key visualizations and tables.
4.  Consolidate all findings into `analysis_results/llm_analysis_input.json`.

### Finding the Latest Insights

The most up-to-date and comprehensive findings are generated by the `complete_comprehensive_analysis.py` script. The key outputs to check are:

*   **`analysis_results/1_main_analysis.png`**: A plot showing the object engagement hierarchy based on grasping frequency.
*   **`analysis_results/2_grasping_analysis.png`**: A detailed 4-panel plot comparing groups, objects, and emotions.
*   **`analysis_results/4_summary_table.tex`**: A LaTeX file with summary tables for group and object comparisons, ready for academic papers.
*   **`analysis_results/llm_analysis_input.json`**: A JSON file containing all processed data and statistical results, optimized for further analysis with LLMs.

## üìÅ The Final Report

The `Final_Report/` directory contains curated outputs and figures that are considered the definitive results of this research project. The items in this folder are typically hand-picked from the `analysis_results` or are generated by specific, secondary scripts like `create_hypothesis2_plot.py`.

This folder represents the final, polished outputs ready for inclusion in a scientific paper or presentation. It may include:

*   **Merged analysis reports (`ALLANALYSIS_REPORT_MERGED.txt`)**.
*   **Final versions of key figures** (e.g., `avg_grasping_analysis.png`, `group_comfort_analysis.png`).
*   **The main LaTeX file (`main.tex`)** for compiling the final paper.

For the definitive summary of the project's findings, always refer to the contents of the `Final_Report/` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Other Scripts

*   `hand_detector.py`: The core MediaPipe hand detection module.
*   `statistical_analysis.py`: Performs specific statistical tests on the dataset.
*   `demo_hand_analysis.py` & `llm_analysis_demo.py`: Scripts to demonstrate the system's capabilities.
*   `create_hypothesis2_plot.py`: A specialized script to generate the plot for Hypothesis 2.
