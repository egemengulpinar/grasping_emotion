## Results

### Overall Study Statistics
The study analyzed hand movement data from 20 participants (10 SEE group, 10 BLIND group) across five different objects. Key overall statistics include:
- Average grasping frequency: 12.02 events/s
- Total grasping events: 45,634
- Average hand detection time: 34.87s

### Group Comparisons
Significant differences were observed between the SEE and BLIND groups:
- SEE group average frequency: 12.74 events/s
- BLIND group average frequency: 11.31 events/s

### Object-wise Analysis
The analysis revealed significant variations in grasping frequency across different objects:
| Object | Mean Frequency (events/s) | Standard Deviation |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| box    | 10.28                     | 5.66               |
| donut  | 7.02                      | 6.41               |
| pig    | 9.48                      | 5.06               |
| spider | 18.09                     | 8.00               |
| toy    | 15.24                     | 5.17               |

### Emotional Responses
The distribution of emotions reported by participants during the study was:
- Neutral: 23 instances
- Happiness: 22 instances
- Disgust: 13 instances
- Nervousness/Fear: 20 instances (combined)

## Discussion

### Hypothesis 1: Different Objects Produce Different Hand Kinematics
The results strongly support the first hypothesis. Significant differences were observed in grasping frequencies across various objects (p < 0.001). Specifically:
- The spider toy elicited the highest grasping frequency (18.09 ± 8.00 events/s)
- The donut elicited the lowest grasping frequency (7.02 ± 6.41 events/s)
- The difference between the highest and lowest frequency objects was statistically significant (t = 4.32, p < 0.001)

### Hypothesis 2: High-Arousal Emotions Lead to Faster Movements
The data provides partial support for the second hypothesis. High-arousal emotions (fear, nervousness) were associated with higher grasping frequencies:
- Spider toy (fear): 18.09 events/s
- Donut (disgust): 7.02 events/s
- Pig toy (happiness): 9.48 events/s

However, the relationship between arousal and movement speed was not linear across all emotions. For instance, the donut (associated with disgust) had the lowest grasping frequency despite being a negative emotion.

### Group Comparison Analysis
The difference between SEE and BLIND groups was statistically significant (t = 2.15, p = 0.045), indicating that visual information influences grasping behavior. The SEE group showed:
- Higher average grasping frequency (12.74 vs 11.31 events/s)
- Greater variability in responses across different objects

### Statistical Significance of Key Findings
1. Object effect: F(4,95) = 12.45, p < 0.001, η² = 0.34
2. Group effect: t(18) = 2.15, p = 0.045, Cohen's d = 0.96
3. Emotion distribution: χ²(8) = 23.14, p = 0.003

### Implications
1. Object-specific characteristics significantly influence grasping behavior
2. Visual information (SEE vs BLIND) affects grasping frequency and variability
3. Emotional arousal has a complex relationship with movement kinematics

The findings suggest that both object characteristics and participant's emotional state play crucial roles in determining hand kinematics during grasping tasks. Future studies should consider these factors when designing experiments or developing rehabilitation protocols.
