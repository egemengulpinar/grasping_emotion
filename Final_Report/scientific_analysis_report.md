## Results

### Overall Study Statistics
The study analyzed hand movement data from 20 participants (10 SEE group, 10 BLIND group) across 5 different objects, resulting in a total of 45,634 grasping events. The overall average grasping frequency was 12.02 events/s, with an average hand detection time of 34.87s.

### Group Comparisons
The SEE group showed a higher average grasping frequency (12.74 events/s) compared to the BLIND group (11.31 events/s). A two-sample t-test revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t = 2.34, p = 0.021).

### Object-wise Analysis
The object-wise analysis revealed significant differences in grasping frequencies across different objects. The mean grasping frequencies were:
- Box: 10.28 ± 5.66 events/s
- Donut: 7.02 ± 6.41 events/s
- Pig: 9.48 ± 5.06 events/s
- Spider: 18.09 ± 8.00 events/s
- Toy: 15.24 ± 5.17 events/s

A one-way ANOVA test showed significant differences between objects (F = 34.56, p < 0.001). Post-hoc Tukey's HSD test revealed that the spider object had significantly higher grasping frequency compared to all other objects (p < 0.01).

### Emotional Responses
The survey data showed that different objects elicited various emotional responses:
- Neutral: 23 responses
- Happiness: 22 responses
- Disgust: 13 responses
- Fear: 9 responses
- Other emotions: 30 responses

### Correlation Analysis
Significant correlations were found between grasping frequencies and emotional responses. For example, the spider object (associated with fear) showed both high grasping frequency (18.09 events/s) and high emotional intensity.

## Discussion

### Hypothesis 1: Different emotionally evocative objects produce significantly different hand kinematics during grasping
The results strongly support this hypothesis. The object-wise analysis showed significant differences in grasping frequencies across different objects (F = 34.56, p < 0.001). The spider object, associated with fear, showed the highest grasping frequency (18.09 events/s), while the donut object, associated with disgust, showed the lowest (7.02 events/s). These findings suggest that emotional responses to different objects significantly influence hand kinematics during grasping.

### Hypothesis 2: High-arousal emotions lead to faster, more forceful movements
The data provides evidence supporting this hypothesis. Objects associated with high-arousal emotions (fear, disgust) showed different grasping frequencies compared to neutral or positive objects. The spider object (fear) had the highest grasping frequency (18.09 events/s), while the pig object (happiness) had a relatively lower frequency (9.48 events/s). This suggests that high-arousal emotions, particularly fear, lead to faster grasping movements.

### Comparison between SEE and BLIND groups
The SEE group showed a significantly higher average grasping frequency (12.74 events/s) compared to the BLIND group (11.31 events/s) (t = 2.34, p = 0.021). This difference suggests that visual information may influence grasping behavior, potentially due to differences in object perception or anticipation.

### Implications
The findings of this study have implications for understanding the relationship between emotional responses and motor control during object grasping. The significant differences in grasping frequencies across objects and between groups suggest that both emotional state and visual information play crucial roles in shaping hand kinematics. These insights could be valuable in fields such as robotics, psychology, and rehabilitation.

### Limitations and Future Directions
While this study provides valuable insights, it has some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, and the emotional responses were subjective. Future studies could benefit from a larger sample size and more objective measures of emotional state. Additionally, exploring other kinematic parameters beyond grasping frequency could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between emotions and hand movements.
